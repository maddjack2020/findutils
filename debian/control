Description: auto-generated package by debmake
 The Findutils package contains programs to find files. Programs are provided
 to search through all the files in a directory tree and to create, maintain,
 and search a database (often faster than the recursive find, but unreliable
 unless the database has been updated recently). Findutils also supplies the
 xargs program, which can be used to run a specified command on each file
 selected by a search.
